In Prisma, relationships between models are defined using `@relation` annotations. In your schema, you have a one-to-one relationship between `User` and `Profile`. Here’s a detailed explanation of the relationship setup:

### Schema Overview

```prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String   @map("firstName")
  role    Role?    @default(USER)
  Profile Profile? @relation(fields: [profileId], references: [id])

  // Uncommenting the next line would cause an error as you can't have `@id` and `@@id` at the same time
  // @@id([email, name])
  @@index([id, email])
  @@map("users")
}

model Profile {
  id     Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  bio    String
  userId Int    @unique
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **One-to-One Relationship:**
   - **`User` Model:**
     - `Profile Profile?`: This defines a one-to-one relationship with the `Profile` model. The `Profile` field is optional (`?`), meaning a `User` may or may not have a `Profile`.
   - **`Profile` Model:**
     - `user User`: This field establishes the inverse side of the relationship, pointing back to the `User` model.

2. **Foreign Key:**
   - In the `Profile` model, `userId Int @unique` is the foreign key that links to the `User` model’s `id` field. The `@unique` constraint ensures that each `Profile` is associated with exactly one `User`.

3. **`@relation` Attribute:**
   - **`@relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])`:** This specifies that the `userId` field in the `Profile` model refers to the `id` field in the `User` model.
   - **`@relation` in `User`:** When defining the relationship in the `User` model, you use `@relation` to specify the relationship fields and references.

4. **Unique Constraints:**
   - In the `Profile` model, `userId` is marked as `@unique`, ensuring that a `userId` can only appear once in the `Profile` table, maintaining a one-to-one relationship.

5. **Indexes and Mapping:**
   - `@@index([id, email])` creates an index on the `id` and `email` fields in the `User` model for efficient querying.
   - `@@map("users")` specifies that the table in the database for the `User` model should be named `users`.

### Relationship Summary:

- **One-to-One:** Each `User` can have at most one `Profile`, and each `Profile` is linked to exactly one `User`.
- **Foreign Key:** `Profile.userId` references `User.id`.
- **Optional Field:** The `Profile` field in `User` is optional, allowing for `User` records without an associated `Profile`.

By defining relationships and using `@relation`, Prisma enables you to manage and query related records efficiently.
