The error you're encountering indicates that Prisma does not allow a model to have more than one primary key definition. In your `User` model, you attempted to define both:

1. A single-field primary key using `@id` on the `id` field.
2. A composite primary key using `@@id([email, name])`.

Since Prisma enforces the rule that each model can only have one primary key, you must choose between these two options. Here's how to resolve the issue:

### Option 1: Use a Single-Field Primary Key (`@id`)
If you want to keep the `id` field as the primary key:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String @unique
  name  String @map("firstName")
  role  String

  @@map("users")
  @@unique([name, role])
  @@index([id, email])
}
```
- Here, the `id` field is the primary key, and it's automatically incremented.
- The `@@id([email, name])` is removed to comply with Prisma's rules.

### Option 2: Use a Composite Primary Key (`@@id`)
If you prefer to use a composite primary key based on `email` and `name`:

```prisma
model User {
  email String
  name  String @map("firstName")
  role  String
  id    Int    @default(autoincrement())

  @@map("users")
  @@id([email, name])
  @@unique([name, role])
  @@index([id, email])
}
```
- The composite primary key is defined using `@@id([email, name])`.
- The `id` field is still present but is no longer a primary key. It's just a regular field with an auto-incrementing value.


You must choose one method to define the primary key for your model to resolve the error.

Let's discuss the specific model-level attributes `@@id([email, name])`, `@@unique([name, role])`, and `@@index([id, email])`.

### 1. **`@@id([email, name])`: Composite Primary Key**
   - **Purpose:** 
     - This defines a composite primary key for the `User` model using the `email` and `name` fields.
   - **Behavior:**
     - In a traditional table, a single column (like `id`) typically serves as the primary key. However, with a composite primary key, two or more columns together uniquely identify each row.
     - In this case, the combination of `email` and `name` must be unique across all rows. No two rows can have the same pair of `email` and `name`.
   - **Use Case:**
     - Composite primary keys are useful when a single column is not sufficient to uniquely identify a row. For instance, in a system where a user might have multiple entries with different names but the same email, this setup ensures that each `email`-`name` pair is unique.

### 2. **`@@unique([name, role])`: Composite Unique Constraint**
   - **Purpose:** 
     - This defines a unique constraint on the combination of the `name` and `role` fields.
   - **Behavior:**
     - A unique constraint ensures that the combination of `name` and `role` is unique across all rows in the table. No two rows can have the same pair of `name` and `role`.
   - **Use Case:**
     - This is useful when you need to enforce that specific combinations of field values are unique. For example, if you have a system where users can have different roles, but each role must be uniquely associated with a name, this constraint ensures no two users can have the same name and role combination.

### 3. **`@@index([id, email])`: Composite Index**
   - **Purpose:**
     - This creates a composite index on the combination of `id` and `email` fields.
   - **Behavior:**
     - An index is a database optimization technique that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. By creating an index on `id` and `email`, you make queries that filter, sort, or join on these fields faster.
     - A composite index works on the combination of the specified fields, which can significantly speed up queries that involve both `id` and `email`.
   - **Use Case:**
     - Use composite indexes to optimize the performance of queries that frequently involve filtering or sorting by multiple columns. For instance, if you often search for users by their `id` and `email`, this index will make those queries faster.

### Summary:
- **Single-Field Primary Key:** Use `@id` on a single field (like `id`) and remove any `@@id` declarations.
- **Composite Primary Key:** Use `@@id([email, name])` for a composite key and remove the `@id` from individual fields.
- **`@@id([email, name])`:** Defines a composite primary key that uniquely identifies each record by the combination of `email` and `name`.
- **`@@unique([name, role])`:** Ensures the combination of `name` and `role` is unique across all records.
- **`@@index([id, email])`:** Creates an index to improve the performance of queries involving the `id` and `email` fields.


These attributes provide powerful ways to enforce data integrity and optimize query performance in your Prisma models.
